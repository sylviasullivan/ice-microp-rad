# ice-microp-rad
This repository contains a variety of Python scripts to visualize, regrid, and analyze ICON v 2.3.0 model output from limited-area domain and trajectory simulations. The project focuses on the interaction of ice microphysics with radiation. Scripts are grouped into those that visualize the domain, dynamical fields, ice / cloud hydrometeor fields, cloud optics values, radiative values, and trajectories. There are also remapping and utility directories.

*Figures_article1.ipynb*, *SI_article1.ipynb* - iPython notebooks that pull from the functions below to generate the 4 main and 5 supplemental figures of the [Communications Earth & Environment publication]{https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-021-00206-7}

*Figures_article2.ipynb*, *SI_article2.ipynb* - iPython notebooks that pull from the functions below to generate figures for a publication on the trajectories in ICON and CLaMS

*Postprocessing1_article2.ipynb*, *Postprocessing2_article2.ipynb* - iPython notebooks that calculate probability distributions from the CLaMS and ICON trajectory output. Postprocessing1 combines all trajectory files and calculates PDFs of cloud ice mass and number, also versus temperature and RHi. Postprocessing2 digitizes and saves ICON-CLaMS differences in cloud ice mass and number along either an absolute or normalized time axis.

*Analysis1_article2.ipynb*, *Analysis2_article2.ipynb* - iPython notebooks that act as workspaces to refine figures prior to Figures_article2. Analysis1_article2 works with StratoClim measurements and ICON synthetic flight tracks. Analysis2_article2 works with differences between ICON and CLaMS trajectory output.
